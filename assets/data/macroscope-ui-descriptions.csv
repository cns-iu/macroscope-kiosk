headerlinkright,What is a Macroscope?,"Have you ever looked at tiny plant cells through a microscope? Or peered into the night sky to see lunar craters with a telescope? Both of these scopes allow you to view objects that are either too small or too distant for the naked eye. Similarly, macroscopes are tools that help you focus on patterns in data that are too large or complex to see unaided. Interactive by nature, you can use them to visually explore data and to ask and answer new questions.",A macroscope is a software tool that helps one see patterns and trends in data that are too large or complex to detect unaided.
headerlinkleft,About <em>Places &amp; Spaces</em>,"In addition to these macroscopes, the full exhibit includes 100 maps of science, sculptures, and other material. The exhibit is meant to inspire cross-disciplinary discussion on how to best track and communicate human activity and scientific progress on a global scale. Drawing from across cultures and across scholarly disciplines, these maps and macrosopes highlight a range of visualization techniques for translating data into actionable insights.<br><br>
The exhibit is curated by the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center at Indiana University. Learn more at scimaps.org.","<em>Places & Spaces</em> is a traveling exhibit that showcases innovative approaches to data visualization, critical for making sense of the large streams of data we confront on a daily basis."
