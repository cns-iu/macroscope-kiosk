Clicking on any carousel item fires up an iframe or a video element depending on the type of URL read by the csv reader.\nThe contents of the carousel is provided by a csv file, which is read by a csv reader service.\nThe iframe or the video tag opens up the contents of the macroscope url.\nThe screen saver is rendered when the app detects that the user has been idle for 7 minutes, the textual content of the screen saver is read from the csv and a video is played in the background. The app uses an idle detector service\nThe modals are generic components, the content of each model is fetched from the csv file.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
