megaregions,3,13,Megaregions of the US,Mapping commuter patterns,/macroscopes/megaregions_with_captions.webm,,,,megaregions.jpg,video,Tap to see the name of your new megaregion.,"<p>These interlinked megaregions, connected by economic ties, suggest that new kinds of geographic categories are necessary if we wish to accurately describe the functional network of flows and relationships which shape our lives in the modern world.</p> <p><em>Megaregions of the US</em> is the work of historical geographer Garrett Dash Nelson, a postdoctoral researcher at Dartmouth College, and Alasdair Rae, an urban and regional data analyst at the University of Sheffield in England. The colorful starbursts are made up of approximately four million lines. Each line shows the linkage of commuters between one census tract and another, with the width proportional to the number of commuters, based on data from the 2010 census. Using an algorithmic technique called <em>community detection</em> to group statistically significant clusters of related places, the map is then divided up into distinct megaregions.</p> <p>Can you find your own hometown, your own commute, and your new megaregion? Look for places on the map where many commutes cut across megaregional boundaries, and for other places where a single city acts as a center of gravity for commuter traffic. What might our political and planning systems look like if we made these megaregions the basis for dividing up the United States?</p>","Every day, millions of Americans leave home and head to work, cutting across neighborhood, city, and state lines. This map depicts how state lines would look if we drew them to reflect the transportation patterns that shape our lives."
sciencepaths,4,13,Science Paths,The random impact rule,http://sciencepaths.kimalbrecht.com/,,,,sciencepaths.jpg,iframe,Each line represents one scientist's career.,"<p>Northeastern University's Center for Complex Research members Kim Albrecht and Albert-L&aacute;szl&oacute; Barab&aacute;si worked with Roberta Sinatra, a theoretical physicist from Budapest, to analyze the publication histories of nearly 10,000 scientists working in seven disciplines, connecting each paper with its long-term impact on the scientific community. They found that the most influential work of a scientist's career is randomly distributed within her body of work. That is, the highest-impact work has the same probability of falling anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist. It could be the first publication, appear mid-career, or emerge last. The team coined this the random impact rule. This visualization shows the random impact rule in all its power. You can explore careers in different disciplines and rank scientists according to different career parameters, like the total number of papers in each scientists' career. You will find impact peaks occurring all over the place, from the beginning of a career on the left to the end of a career on the right.</p>","Follow it to find the peak. Can you predict the timing of a scientist's most influential paper? Do scientists tend to produce their most influential work at the end of their career? In a word, no."

Humans can differentiate thousands of different odors. Yet, city officials and urban planners deal only with the management of a few bad odors. In creating <em>Smelly Maps</em>, University of Turin computer science professor Rossano Schifanella and Bell Labs researchers Luca Maria Aiello and Daniele Quercia teamed up to introduce a new stream of research that celebrates the complex aromas of our cities and makes it possible to use this information in urban design.</p> <p>To map urban smellscapes, the project team first created a lexicon of smell-related words. Then, they gathered geotagged social media posts from Flickr, Instagram, and Twitter that included smell-related words. Finally, the smells people posted about were mapped on each street segment.</p> <p>Click on a street to see how it smells. As you might expect, nature smells are strong near parks and animal smells dominate at the zoo. Where do you find the strongest food smells?</p>","The Good City Life team gathered geotagged social media posts from Flickr, Instagram, and Twitter that included smell-related words and mapped them.

Find a place.,"<p>Whether we like it or complain about it, bask in it or suffer from it, we all are affected by the weather. This essential truth becomes readily apparent when viewing <em>Earth</em>, the work of software engineer Cameron Beccario.</p> <p>Using data from the Global Forecast System, <em>Earth</em> visualizes worldwide weather patterns using animated wind streams, color coded according to velocity, that sweep across a three-dimensional globe. Truly interactive, the visualization allows the user to spin the globe and zoom in on a desired location. Tapping on that location will then bring up further information about exact coordinates, wind speed, and temperature, with all information updated every three hours.</p> <p>The world itself may be seen from different perspectives, as the visualization offers nine different projections, such as conic equidistant, stereographic, or Waterman Butterfly. When <em>Earth</em> was first introduced in December 2013, it only visualized wind patterns. Since then, however, Beccario has increased the number of overlays to include such factors as carbon monoxide concentration, dust and sulfate extinction, along with the measured temperature. <em>Earth</em> also shows the perceived temperature which Beccario calls the Misery Index, borrowing a term from economics.</p>","Watch the weather unfold with data updates every three hours.

H. Leetaru, an expert on big data and global society. It uses as its source material, quite literally, the news of the world. The visualization explores how news stories group countries into distinct clusters, creating ageographic network over the planet, visualizing ""communities"" as seen through the eyes of the world's presses. In essence, for every monitored news article published anywhere in the world, it compiles a list of other countries also mentioned in those articles.</p> <p>It is important to note that it is not how often coverage from a country mentions other countries; it is how often coverage mentions two countries in the same article. In other words, it is about context.</p> <p>Countries that are frequently mentioned together might reflect geographic proximity, but also economic and political ties, or joint involvement in a major international event. Blue incoming lines indicate countries where at least 10% of the coverage mentioning the selected country also mention the destination country.</p> <p>The size and number of energy pulses moving along the line indicate how often two countries are connected in the news. In a given week, nearly every country is mentioned alongside of every other country at least once, so the visualization uses the cutoff of 10% to highlight only the strongest connections.</p>","Connections are drawn between countries based on the news: online, television, print, and radio in over 65 different languages. Do you notice any surprising connections? This is the power of computing on the entire world.

The figures whose migrations are traced are remarkably varied: from the Greek mathematician Pythagoras to the American Jazz Age entertainer Al Jolson, from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius to the Gothic painter Henry Fuseli, and from the composer Carl Maria von Weber to the father of sexuality studies, Havelock Ellis.</p> <p>Birthplaces, represented by blue dots, are connected by arcs to places of death, denoted by red dots. The animation reveals how increased concentrations of death places indicate how different cultural centers rise and fall in importance: for instance, how Paris and London supplant the dominance of Rome, how New York pulls Europeans from their places of birth, and how America's west coast lures Easterners to cross plains and mountains with promises of a new life.</p>","<em>Charting Culture</em> plots life and death locations for more than 120,000 notable European and American cultural figures over the past 2,600 years.
